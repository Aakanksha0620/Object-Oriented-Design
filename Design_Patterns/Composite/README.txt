There are times when you feel a need of a tree data structure in your code. There are many variations to the
tree data structure, but sometimes there is a need of a tree in which both branches as well as leafs of the
tree should be treated as uniformly.

The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into a tree structure to represent the part-whole hierarchy
which means you can create a tree of objects that is made of different parts, but that can be treated as a whole
one big thing. Composite lets clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, thatâ€™s
the intent of the Composite Pattern.


The Composite Pattern has four participants:

    Component

    Leaf

    Composite

    Client
