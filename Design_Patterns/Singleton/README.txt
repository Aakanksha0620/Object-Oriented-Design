INTENT
------

Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
Encapsulated "just-in-time initialization" or "initialization on first use".
Problem
Application needs one, and only one, instance of an object. Additionally, lazy initialization and global access are necessary.


DISCUSSION
----------

Make the class of the single instance object responsible for creation, initialization, access, and enforcement. Declare the instance as a private static data member. Provide a public static member function that encapsulates all initialization code, and provides access to the instance.

The client calls the accessor function (using the class name and scope resolution operator) whenever a reference to the single instance is required.

Singleton should be considered only if all three of the following criteria are satisfied:

Ownership of the single instance cannot be reasonably assigned
Lazy initialization is desirable

Global access is not otherwise provided for
If ownership of the single instance, when and how initialization occurs, and global access are not issues, Singleton is not sufficiently interesting.

The Singleton pattern can be extended to support access to an application-specific number of instances.

The "static member function accessor" approach will not support subclassing of the Singleton class. If subclassing is desired, refer to the discussion in the book.


DELETATION
----------
Deleting a Singleton class/instance is a non-trivial design problem. See "To Kill A Singleton" by John Vlissides for a discussion.

## Intent
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of
access to it.


## Explanation
Real world example

> There can only be one ivory tower where the wizards study their magic. The same enchanted ivory tower is always used by the wizards. Ivory tower here is singleton.

In plain words

> Ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created.

Wikipedia says

> In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

**Programmatic Example**

Joshua Bloch, Effective Java 2nd Edition p.18

> A single-element enum type is the best way to implement a singleton

```
public enum EnumIvoryTower {
  INSTANCE;
}
```

Then in order to use

```
EnumIvoryTower enumIvoryTower1 = EnumIvoryTower.INSTANCE;
EnumIvoryTower enumIvoryTower2 = EnumIvoryTower.INSTANCE;
assertEquals(enumIvoryTower1, enumIvoryTower2); // true
```

## Applicability
Use the Singleton pattern when

* there must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point
* when the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code

## Typical Use Case

* the logging class
* managing a connection to a database
* file manager

## Real world examples

* [java.lang.Runtime#getRuntime()](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#getRuntime%28%29)
* [java.awt.Desktop#getDesktop()](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Desktop.html#getDesktop--)
* [java.lang.System#getSecurityManager()](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#getSecurityManager--)


## Consequences

* Violates Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by controlling their own creation and lifecycle.
* Encourages using a global shared instance which prevents an object and resources used by this object from being deallocated.     
* Creates tightly coupled code. The clients of the Singleton become difficult to test.
* Makes it almost impossible to subclass a Singleton.

Participants

    The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Singleton   (LoadBalancer)
defines an Instance operation that lets clients access its unique instance. Instance is a class operation.
responsible for creating and maintaining its own unique instance.
