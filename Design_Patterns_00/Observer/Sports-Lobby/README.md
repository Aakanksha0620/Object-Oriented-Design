Soprts Lobby Implementations With Observer Design Pattern


The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object
changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. The Observer pattern
describes these dependencies. The key objects in this pattern are subject and observer. A subject
may have any number of dependent observers. All observers are notified whenever the subject undergoes
a change in its state. In response, each observer will query the subject to synchronize its state
with the subject state.
