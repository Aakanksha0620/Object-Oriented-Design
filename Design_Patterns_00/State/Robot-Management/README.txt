STATE DESIGN PATTERN
--------------------

THE STATE DESIGN PATTERN ALLOWS AN OBJECT TO ALTER ITS BEHAVIOR WHEN ITS INTERNAL STATE CHANGES.
THE OBJECT WILL APPEAR TO CHANGE ITS CLASS.

THE STATE OF AN OBJECT CAN BE DEFINED AS ITS EXACT CONDITION AT ANY GIVEN POINT OF TIME, DEPENDING
ON THE VALUES OF ITS PROPERTIES OR ATTRIBUTES. THE SET OF METHODS IMPLEMENTED BY A CLASS CONSTITUTES
THE BEHAVIOR OF ITS INSTANCES. WHENEVER THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE VALUES OF ITS ATTRIBUTES, WE SAY THAT
THE STATE OF AN OBJECT HAS CHANGED.


THE STATE PATTERN IS USEFUL IN DESIGNING AN EFFICIENT STRUCTURE FOR A CLASS, A TYPICAL INSTANCE OF WHICH
CAN EXIST IN MANY DIFFERENT STATES AND EXHIBIT DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR DEPENDING ON THE STATE IT IS IN. IN OTHER
WORDS, IN THE CASE OF AN OBJECT OF SUCH A CLASS, SOME OR ALL OF ITS BEHAVIOR IS COMPLETELY INFLUENCED BY ITS
CURRENT STATE. IN THE STATE DESIGN PATTERN TERMINOLOGY, SUCH A CLASS IS REFERRED TO AS A CONTEXT CLASS. A
CONTEXT OBJECT CAN ALTER ITS BEHAVIOR WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE IN ITS INTERNAL STATE AND IS ALSO REFERRED AS
A STATEFUL OBJECT.



1. CONTEXT
DEFINES THE INTERFACE OF INTEREST TO CLIENTS.
MAINTAINS AN INSTANCE OF A CONCRETESTATE SUBCLASS THAT DEFINES THE CURRENT STATE.

2. STATE
DEFINES AN INTERFACE FOR ENCAPSULATING THE BEHAVIOR ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR STATE OF THE CONTEXT.

3. CONCRETESTATE SUBCLASSES
EACH SUBCLASS IMPLEMENTS A BEHAVIOR ASSOCIATED WITH A STATE OF THE CONTEXT.
